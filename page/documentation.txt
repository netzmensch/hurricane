+Documentation

Although Hurricane contains only simple markup, sometimes a little documentation helps:

++basic parsers

+++paragraph
This one is the simplest: every line in an page.txt file is an paragraph.
----
+++headlines
If you want to add an headline, put some "+" in front of it. Every "+" stands for an higher head value.

for example:
"+Headline" stands for <h1>Headline</h1>
"++Headline" stands for <h2>Headline</h2>
...
----
+++bold text
just wrap &#91;b&#93;the content&#91;/b&#93; and it will be bold.
----
+++link
the most powerful element of the web is the link. Basic syntax:

&#91;link text,http://url.com&#93;

for internal links do this:
&#91;contact,/contact&#93;
----
+++images
for default image support, add following:

&#91;&#91;image.jpg&#93;&#93;

The img path is relative to /page. The converted image tags contain the twitter bootstrap responsive class, so they will always fit to current screen size.
